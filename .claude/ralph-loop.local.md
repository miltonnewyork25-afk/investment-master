Read RALPH_PROMPT.md and EVOLUTION.md, then execute the next iteration step. Fix machinery backtest to pass 70%+, then create each subsequent industry (industrial, mining, chemicals, airlines) with backtests. Each industry must score >= 70% and produce new insights. Modify backtest.py scoring functions, run python3 src/data-pipeline/processors/backtest.py, update EVOLUTION.md, and git commit after each major step.
