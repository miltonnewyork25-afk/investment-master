  "competitive_dynamics": "TSMC's dominance is accelerating, not declining. The company's 71% market share in Q3 2025 represents a structural moat built on: (1) unmatched manufacturing yield at advanced nodes, (2) deep customer co-optimization relationships spanning decades, (3) the virtuous cycle where leading customers fund next-gen R&D through premium pricing, (4) CoWoS advanced packaging becoming a critical AI infrastructure bottleneck that only TSMC can solve at scale. Samsung's foundry business is losing ground despite similar technology ambitions, while Intel Foundry Services remains pre-revenue at meaningful scale. The AI supercycle disproportionately benefits TSMC as virtually all frontier AI chips (NVIDIA, AMD, Google TPU, Amazon Trainium) are manufactured on TSMC advanced nodes. The competitive gap is widening, not narrowing.",
