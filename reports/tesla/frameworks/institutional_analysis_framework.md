### **Valuation Integration Formula**
```
Tesla Total Value = Σ(Business Unit Value × Technology Multiplier × Market Position × Engineering Capability × Confidence Score)
```

## 5. Monte Carlo Framework Implementation

### **Scenario Modeling Architecture**
Following ARK Invest's probabilistic approach:

#### **Base Case Probability Distribution**
- **Conservative** (25% probability): Lower adoption, increased competition
- **Base Case** (50% probability): Management guidance achieved
- **Optimistic** (25% probability): Technology breakthroughs, market expansion

#### **Key Variable Ranges**
| Variable | Conservative | Base | Optimistic | Distribution |
|----------|-------------|------|------------|-------------|
| 2030 Deliveries | 2.5M | 3.5M | 5.0M | Normal |
| FSD Penetration | 25% | 45% | 70% | Beta |
| Robotaxi Launch | 2028 | 2026 | 2025 | Triangular |
| Energy Growth | 30% CAGR | 50% CAGR | 70% CAGR | Log-normal |
