## Executive Summary

Tesla exhibits extreme macroeconomic sensitivity characteristic of high-growth technology companies, requiring sophisticated cycle management and hedging strategies. Critical macroeconomic findings:

- **Duration Risk**: Tesla trades as 12-15 year duration asset, highly sensitive to interest rate changes
- **Recession Vulnerability**: 40-60% revenue decline potential in severe recession due to luxury positioning
- **Inflation Hedge**: Moderate pricing power provides partial inflation protection but raw material exposure remains
- **Economic Cycle Alpha**: Superior performance during expansion phases (+200-400 bps vs market) but amplified downturns

**Investment Implication**: Tesla requires sophisticated macroeconomic positioning with interest rate hedging and economic cycle timing for optimal risk-adjusted returns.
