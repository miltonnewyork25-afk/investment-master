## Methodology

For each undervalued stock, we verify it's not a value trap by checking:

2. Competitive Moat (qualitative assessment)
3. ROIC vs WACC (value creation)
4. Cash Flow Quality (OCF/Net Income ratio)
5. Management Alignment (insider ownership/compensation structure)

**Passing Criteria**: ≥3 out of 5 checks passed → Safe to invest
