## The 6 Qualified Stocks

| Rank | Ticker | Sector | Score | Sharpe | MDD | CAGR | Why It Won |
|------|--------|--------|-------|--------|-----|------|------------|
| 1 | **RTX** | Defense | 76.15 | 1.01 | -32.8% | 26.9% | Best overall balance |
| 2 | **LLY** | Healthcare | 75.15 | 1.14 | -34.5% | **40.1%** | Highest returns + consistency |
| 3 | **XOM** | Energy | 75.00 | 0.95 | **-20.5%** | 29.8% | Best drawdown control |
| 4 | **WMT** | Retail | 73.00 | 0.90 | -25.7% | 21.9% | Best tail risk + consistency |
| 5 | **GS** | Finance | 71.05 | 0.96 | -32.8% | 30.7% | Asymmetric upside (Sortino 2.07) |
| 6 | **COST** | Retail | 64.05 | 0.84 | -31.4% | 24.1% | Balanced across all metrics |

## Investment Recommendation

### Core Portfolio (70-100% allocation)
**Use all 6 Tier 2 stocks equally or weighted by score**:
- RTX: 18%
- LLY: 18%
- XOM: 18%
- WMT: 16%
- GS: 15%
- COST: 15%

**Expected Characteristics**:
- Sharpe: ~0.95 (vs S&P 500: ~0.60)
- MDD: ~-30% (vs S&P 500: ~-40%)
- CAGR: ~28% (vs S&P 500: ~13%)

### Tactical Additions (0-30% allocation)
**If willing to accept higher risk**:
- **AVGO** (Score: 70.05): Failed MDD (-41%) but all other metrics excellent. Recent correction may be entry point.
- **NVDA** (Score: 65.10): 60.8% CAGR but -66.3% MDD. Only for high risk tolerance.

---

## Why So Few Qualified?

**2022 Was Brutal**:
- Fed hiked rates 0% → 5%+
- Tech/Growth collapsed -40% to -60%
- Only defensive sectors survived with dignity

**System Working Correctly**:
- High Sharpe ≠ Safe (NVDA: 1.31 Sharpe but -66% MDD)
- MDD threshold prevented lottery-like stocks
- 6.5% pass rate validates selectivity

---

## Notable Exclusions

### High Scores But Failed MDD

**AVGO** (Score 70.05, MDD -41.1%):
- Best Sharpe (1.23) and Sortino (2.61) in universe
- 96% rolling Sharpe consistency (best in class)
- Failed MDD threshold by 1.1 percentage points
- **Consider tactically** - All other metrics exceptional

**NVDA** (Score 65.10, MDD -66.3%):
- Highest CAGR (60.8%) in universe
- Catastrophic drawdown (Nov 2021 → Oct 2022)
- **High risk, high reward** - Not suitable for core holdings

### Low Returns Despite Good Risk Control

**KO** (Score 47, MDD -17.3%):
- Best drawdown control
- Best VaR/CVaR (tail risk)
- But: Only 12.4% CAGR, Sharpe 0.49 (below threshold)

**MCD** (Score 47, MDD -17.2%):
- Second-best drawdown control
- Ultra-low volatility (13.7%)
- But: Only 9.9% CAGR, Sharpe 0.40 (below threshold)

## Risk Warnings

### Tier 2 Not Risk-Free

**All 6 stocks experienced -20% to -35% drawdowns**:
- Not suitable for extreme risk aversion
- Expected to experience -30%+ drawdowns in future bear markets
- Risk-adjusted ≠ Low-risk

### Concentration Risk

**All 6 from US Large/Mid-Cap**:
- No international exposure
- No small-cap exposure
- No bonds/commodities

**Sector Concentration**:
- 2/6 are retail (WMT, COST)
- Missing: Tech, Healthcare (only LLY), Consumer Staples

### Historical Performance ≠ Future Results

**5-year window is specific regime**:
- Favored defensive sectors
- Tech underperformed on risk-adjusted basis
- Different market regime could flip results

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Are you building a core portfolio?
│
├─ YES → Use all 6 Tier 2 stocks (equal or score-weighted)
│         Expected: Sharpe ~0.95, MDD ~-30%, CAGR ~28%
│
└─ NO → Seeking specific exposure?
         │
         ├─ Highest returns → LLY (40.1% CAGR)
         ├─ Best downside protection → XOM (-20.5% MDD)
         ├─ Lowest tail risk → WMT (VaR -6.7%)
         ├─ Most consistent → WMT (52% Sharpe consistency)
         ├─ Best overall → RTX (Score 76.15)
         └─ Tactical tech exposure → Consider AVGO (failed MDD but strong metrics)

Can you tolerate >40% drawdowns?
│
├─ YES → Consider adding AVGO, NVDA (Tier 3 high-scorers)
│
└─ NO → Stick to Tier 2 or add defensive (KO, MCD)

Risk tolerance?
│
├─ High → Enhanced Portfolio (Core 70% + AVGO/NVDA 30%)
├─ Moderate → Pure Tier 2 (All 6 stocks)
└─ Low → Defensive Mix (WMT/XOM/COST + KO/MCD)
```

## Bottom Line

**6 stocks passed rigorous screening**:
- RTX, LLY, XOM, WMT, GS, COST

**All showed**:
- Sharpe ≥ 0.8 (risk-adjusted returns beat market)
- MDD > -35% (controlled drawdowns)
- Positive risk-adjusted scores across all dimensions

**Portfolio Recommendation**:
- **Start here**: Use all 6 equally (16.67% each)
- **Or weighted**: Use score-based weighting (RTX 18%, LLY 18%, etc.)
- **Then optimize**: Adjust based on personal risk tolerance and views

**Expected Result**:
- 2x Sharpe of S&P 500
- 25% better drawdown control
- 2x+ returns of S&P 500

**Caveat**: Past performance ≠ future results, but risk-adjusted approach increases probability of success.
