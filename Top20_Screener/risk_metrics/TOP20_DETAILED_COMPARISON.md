## Key Insights from Top 20

### Tier 2 Analysis (6 stocks in top 20)

**Characteristics of Success**:
1. **Balanced metrics** - No single spectacular metric, but all metrics acceptable
2. **MDD control** - All Tier 2 have MDD between -20.5% (XOM) and -34.5% (LLY)
3. **Downside protection** - Sortino >> Sharpe for all (asymmetric returns)
4. **Sector diversity** - Defense, Healthcare, Energy, Retail (2x), Finance

**Why These 6 Beat the Rest**:
- **RTX**: Best overall balance (1.01 Sharpe, -32.8% MDD)
- **LLY**: Highest returns (40.1% CAGR) with good control
- **XOM**: Best MDD control (-20.5%) + solid returns
- **WMT**: Best tail risk (VaR -6.7%) + high consistency (52%)
- **GS**: Strong Sortino (2.07) shows asymmetric upside
- **COST**: Moderate on all metrics, passes all thresholds

- Best rolling Sharpe consistency (96%)
- Rolling Sharpe mean of 1.54 (excellent)

**Why It Failed**:
- MDD of -41.1% (below -40% threshold)
- Single metric failure killed it

**Should You Still Consider It?**:
- **YES, tactically** - All other metrics exceptional
- Drawdown occurred Dec 2024 → Apr 2025 (recent)
- May be AI correction providing entry point
- Use as satellite position (10-15% max)

---

#### NVDA (Rank 8) - "High Risk, High Reward"
**Why It's Tempting**:
- Highest CAGR (60.8%) in top 20
- Strong Sharpe (1.31)
- AI revolution leader

**Why It Failed**:
- Catastrophic MDD (-66.3%)
- Peak to trough Nov 2021 → Oct 2022

---

#### KLAC (Rank 7) - "Semiconductor Cyclicality"
**Profile**:

---

### Defensive Stocks That Almost Made It

#### KO (Rank 18) & MCD (Rank 19)
**Strengths**:
- Best MDD control (-17.3%, -17.2%)
- Best VaR/CVaR (tail risk)
- Ultra-low volatility (13.7%-13.9%)

**Weakness**:
- Low absolute returns (9.9%-12.4% CAGR)
- Low Sharpe (0.40-0.49)
- Not enough return to justify over risk-free 4.2%

**Why They Failed**:
- Sharpe < 0.5 threshold
- Too defensive = underperformance in rising market
- Better for capital preservation than growth
