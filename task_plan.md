## Context
- Current location: /Users/milton/投资大师/.worktrees/半导体
- Framework version: Deep-Dive Protocol v7.0
- Active company research: MU (Phase 0 completion pending)
- Available skills: 20+ including new additions

## Key Questions
1. What specific new capabilities do the MCP integrations provide?
2. How do new skills change the optimal research workflow?
3. Where should the investment thermometer integrate into existing phases?
4. Which agents need modification to leverage new data sources?
5. What new research dimensions should be standard vs optional?

## Next Steps
Start with Phase 1: Complete system inventory by examining all available skills, MCP tools, and strategic documents.
