## Section 1: Consumer Health Signals

### 1.1 Consumer Confidence Index (Conference Board)

**Current Reading**: 84.5 (January 2026)
**Prior Month**: 94.2 (December 2025, revised up)
**Direction**: DETERIORATING -- down 9.7 points in a single month

**Historical Context**: This is the lowest reading since May 2014 (82.2), surpassing even COVID-19 pandemic depths. The Expectations Index plunged to 65.1, well below the 80 threshold that historically signals recession risk. All five sub-components deteriorated simultaneously.

**COST Impact Assessment**: **MIXED-TO-POSITIVE**. Paradoxically, collapsing consumer confidence tends to benefit Costco. When consumers feel economically anxious, they trade down from specialty retailers and restaurants to warehouse club bulk buying. The Conference Board data shows a "confidence-spending paradox" -- credit card data and actual retail spending remain resilient even as sentiment craters. For Costco, this is the sweet spot: consumers feel anxious enough to seek value, but have enough income to maintain spending. This pattern was visible in the January comp sales report (+7.1%), which accelerated even as confidence collapsed.

**Signal**: Confidence collapse = value-seeking behavior = Costco traffic tailwind.

### 1.2 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment

**Current Reading**: 56.4 (January 2026 final), ~60 (February preliminary, releasing today 2/6)
**Prior Month**: 52.9 (December 2025)
**Direction**: IMPROVING -- second straight monthly increase, 5-month high

**Historical Context**: Despite the uptick, overall sentiment remains more than 20% below its level a year ago. Year-ahead inflation expectations declined to 4.0% (lowest since January 2025), but longer-run expectations edged up to 3.3%. The divergence between Conference Board (collapsing) and Michigan (modestly improving) is notable -- Conference Board is more employment-sensitive, while Michigan captures broader price-level frustration.

**COST Impact Assessment**: **MODERATELY POSITIVE**. The Michigan data shows consumers are adapting to the new price reality rather than pulling back entirely. The slight improvement in sentiment, combined with declining short-term inflation expectations, suggests consumers are finding ways to manage their budgets. Costco's value proposition is a key part of that adaptation. The 4.0% inflation expectation, while elevated, is manageable for Costco's pricing power -- the company can absorb or pass through cost increases more effectively than smaller retailers.

### 1.3 Personal Savings Rate

**Current Reading**: 3.5% (November 2025, latest available)
**Trend**: Declining from 4.7% (September) to 3.7% (October) to 3.5% (November)
**2026 Forecast**: 4.3% (expected to edge higher)
**Direction**: DETERIORATING in recent months

**Historical Context**: The current 3.5% rate is well below the pre-pandemic norm of ~7-8% and far below the pandemic peak of 31.8% (April 2020). It approaches the 2005 record low of 1.4%. Consumers are spending more of their disposable income, leaving a thinner buffer.

**COST Impact Assessment**: **NUANCED**. A declining savings rate has two implications for Costco:
- **Negative**: Less financial cushion means consumers may defer large discretionary purchases (electronics, furniture, jewelry -- categories where Costco competes).
- **Positive**: Budget-constrained consumers actively seek the best value per dollar, which is Costco's core proposition. Bulk buying at Costco reduces per-unit costs, making it a rational response to savings pressure.
- **Net**: Slightly positive for core grocery/consumables traffic, slightly negative for discretionary ancillary categories.

### 1.4 Credit Card Delinquency Rates

**Current Reading**: 2.93% (Q3 2025, latest available)
**Trend**: Flattening after sustained rise since 2022
**Direction**: STABILIZING at elevated levels

**Historical Context**: The 2.93% rate is the highest since Q4 2011 (3.25%). However, the stabilization pattern is encouraging -- the rate stopped climbing after six consecutive quarters of increases. The Federal Reserve attributes this stabilization to slower credit card borrowing growth since early 2024 and lagged effects of tighter bank lending standards.

**COST Impact Assessment**: **NEUTRAL**. Costco's customer base skews toward higher-income households (Executive members represent ~73% of sales). The delinquency surge is concentrated in subprime borrowers and younger demographics who are less likely to be Costco members. However, the stabilization removes a tail risk -- if delinquencies had continued accelerating, it would eventually have impacted Costco's middle-income member cohort.

### 1.5 Real Wage Growth

**Current Reading**: +0.92% real wage growth (Dec 2024 to Dec 2025); nominal wages +3.8% vs. inflation +2.7%
**Trend**: Positive real wage growth in every month since February 2024
**2026 Outlook**: Real private sector weekly earnings on track to rise ~4%
**Direction**: IMPROVING

**Historical Context**: After a brutal period from 2021-2023 where inflation outpaced wages (cumulative real wage loss), workers have now enjoyed nearly two years of real wage gains. However, cumulative inflation-adjusted wage growth since 2020 remains close to zero -- workers are only now recovering lost purchasing power.

**COST Impact Assessment**: **POSITIVE**. Real wage growth is the single most important macro signal for Costco's business model. When workers have more real purchasing power, they can: (a) afford the $65/$130 membership fee without hesitation, (b) buy in bulk rather than making smaller, more frequent purchases at convenience stores, and (c) upgrade to Executive membership ($130) for the 2% reward. The +0.92% real wage gain translates to roughly $12/week extra per worker -- enough to cover the incremental cost of a Costco membership over 5-6 weeks.

## Section 2: Retail-Specific Leading Indicators

### 2.1 Costco Comparable Sales (January 2026 -- Released 2/4/2026)

| Metric | January 2026 | December 2025 | Trend |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Net Sales | $21.33B | -- | +9.3% YoY |
| Total Company Comp | +7.1% | +9.6% | Strong |
| Comp ex-Gas/FX | +6.4% | +7.3% | Strong |
| US Comp | +5.8% | +8.3% | Solid |
| Canada Comp | +11.4% | +12.5% | Very Strong |
| Other International | +9.5% | +12.5% | Strong |
| E-Commerce Comp | +34.4% | +24.1% | Accelerating |
| Foot Traffic | +2.4% | -- | Positive |

**Analysis**: January comps of +7.1% (headline) and +6.4% (core, ex-gas/FX) represent strong fundamental performance. While the headline number decelerated from December's +9.6%, that month benefited from favorable holiday calendar shifts. The critical signal here is the e-commerce acceleration from +24.1% to +34.4% -- this is the fastest digital growth rate in recent quarters and suggests the digital transformation is gaining momentum. US foot traffic growth of +2.2% confirms the in-store proposition remains healthy.

**Lunar New Year Note**: The calendar shift negatively impacted Other International comps by ~4.0% and Total Company by ~0.5%. Adjusting for this, underlying international growth was even stronger.

**YTD Context**: First 22 weeks net sales of $123.16B (+8.5% YoY) demonstrate sustained momentum.

### 2.2 Foot Traffic Data

**Current Reading**: Costco foot traffic +2.4% YoY (January 2026, company-reported); Placer.ai showed +7.7% YoY for Costco in January 2025
**Direction**: POSITIVE but moderating

**Historical Context**: Warehouse clubs as a category have sustained above-market foot traffic growth: Costco +6.0%, Sam's Club +3.2%, BJ's +5.9% in Q3 2025. Costco's introduction of early Executive Member shopping hours has improved visit duration efficiency -- 30-45 minute visits rose while both shorter (<30 min) and longer (45-60 min) visits declined.

**COST Impact Assessment**: **POSITIVE**. Traffic growth, even at a moderating pace, demonstrates the physical store model's durability in an e-commerce era. The visit duration optimization suggests operational improvements that could support higher throughput without additional store investment.

### 2.3 Gas Prices

**Current Reading**: $2.89/gallon national average (February 2026)
**Prior Period**: $2.81/gallon (early January 2026 -- lowest since March 2021)
**6-Year Average**: $3.06/gallon
**Direction**: LOW-STABLE, slight uptick from January lows

**Historical Context**: Gas prices are running near multi-year lows. The 2026 annual average is forecast to fall below $3.00 for the first time since 2020 (GasBuddy projection). This is driven by lower crude prices, adequate refining capacity, and subdued winter demand.

**COST Impact Assessment**: **MIXED**. Gas prices affect Costco through two channels:
- **Traffic driver (+)**: Cheap gas at Costco (typically 20-30 cents below market) draws members to the physical store. Once at the gas station, ~60% of members also shop inside. Low gas prices reduce the absolute savings differential, slightly weakening this traffic magnet.
- **Fuel margin (-)**: When gas prices are low and stable, Costco's per-gallon margin compresses. Gas is a meaningful revenue line (~10% of sales) but contributes minimal profit.
- **Consumer budget (+)**: Low gas prices free up discretionary income, some of which flows to Costco.
- **Net**: Moderately positive for same-store sales, neutral-to-negative for fuel segment profitability.

### 2.4 Food-at-Home vs. Food-Away-from-Home CPI Spread

**Current Reading (December 2025)**:
- Food-at-home CPI: +2.4% YoY
- Food-away-from-home CPI: +4.1% YoY
- Spread: 1.7 percentage points favoring home cooking
**2026 Forecast**: Food-at-home +1.7% vs. Food-away-from-home +4.6% (spread widening to 2.9pp)
**Direction**: WIDENING -- increasingly favors grocery retailers over restaurants

**Historical Context**: The persistent and widening gap between restaurant prices and grocery prices is a structural tailwind for Costco. When eating out costs 4%+ more each year while groceries rise only ~2%, consumer behavior shifts toward cooking at home, buying in bulk, and seeking value-oriented grocery options.

**COST Impact Assessment**: **STRONGLY POSITIVE**. This is one of the most favorable macro signals for Costco. The company is the largest retailer of organic produce and fresh meat in the US, and its bulk food pricing is typically 20-30% below conventional grocery stores. The widening food CPI spread effectively acts as a customer acquisition funnel -- every household that shifts one restaurant meal per week to a home-cooked meal using Costco groceries represents incremental basket size and visit frequency.

## Section 3: COST-Specific Signals

### 3.1 Membership Economics

| Metric | Current | Prior Year | Change |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Total Paid Members | 81.4M | 77.4M | +5.2% |
| Executive Members | 39.7M | 36.4M | +9.1% |
| Executive % of Paid | 48.8% | 47.0% | +1.8pp |
| US/Canada Renewal Rate | 92.3% | ~92.0% | Stable |
| Worldwide Renewal Rate | 89.8% | ~89.5% | Stable |
| Membership Revenue (FY25) | $5.3B | $4.8B | +10.3% |
| FY26 Membership Rev Growth | -- | -- | +9.1% est |

**Analysis**: The membership flywheel remains the most powerful element of Costco's business model. Three signals stand out:

1. **Executive membership growing nearly 2x the pace of total membership** (9.1% vs 5.2%): This means existing members are upgrading, which increases per-member revenue and deepens loyalty (Executive members spend ~2x what Gold Star members spend).

2. **Renewal rates stable post-fee-hike**: The September 2024 fee increase ($5 for Gold Star to $65, $10 for Executive to $130 -- the first hike in 7 years) has not caused measurable attrition. This confirms pricing power.

3. **Membership revenue growth of +9-10%**: This is nearly pure profit (membership fees drop almost entirely to the bottom line) and represents the most predictable, recurring revenue stream in all of retail.

**Risk Flag**: Costco management has signaled potential slight downtick in renewal rates into 2026 as the fee increase fully cycles through the member base. This warrants monitoring in Q2 and Q3 fiscal 2026 earnings.

### 3.2 E-Commerce Penetration & Digital Transformation

| Metric | Q1 FY2026 | Prior Quarter | Trend |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------|
| E-Commerce Comp Growth | +20.5% | +14.8% (Q3 FY25) | Accelerating |
| January Digital Comp | +34.4% | -- | Strong acceleration |
| Website Traffic Growth | +24% YoY | -- | Strong |
| App Traffic Growth | +48% YoY | -- | Very strong |

**Analysis**: E-commerce has been Costco's lagging metric for years (the company was famously late to digital). The current acceleration suggests the investment thesis has shifted:

- **Same-day delivery via Instacart/Uber Eats/DoorDash** is growing faster than overall digital, addressing the convenience gap.
- **Personalization capabilities** launched in Q1 (product recommendations based on search history) represent a catch-up to digital-native competitors.
- **App traffic growing 2x website traffic** indicates mobile-first behavior adoption among members.

**COST Impact Assessment**: **POSITIVE -- thesis enhancer**. Digital is no longer a weakness; it's becoming a growth vector. However, e-commerce still represents a modest share of total sales (~7-8% estimated), so the P&L impact is incremental rather than transformative at this stage.

### 3.3 Kirkland Signature Expansion

**Current Status**: 45 new products launched in late 2025; continued expansion into new categories
**2026 Strategy**: More local sourcing to cut carbon footprint and mitigate tariff exposure
**Direction**: EXPANDING

**Analysis**: Kirkland Signature is Costco's strategic Swiss Army knife:
- **Margin tool**: Private label margins are typically 200-400 bps higher than national brand margins.
- **Tariff shield**: By controlling sourcing and manufacturing, Costco can redirect production to non-tariffed countries faster than brands relying on fixed supply chains.
- **Value reinforcement**: Kirkland products are priced 15-20% below comparable national brands while maintaining quality parity (in blind tests, Kirkland often wins).
- **Customer loyalty**: Kirkland is only available at Costco, creating switching costs. A member who relies on Kirkland diapers, olive oil, and vodka has high renewal probability.

The accelerated expansion of Kirkland into new categories (including the new lager, revamped diapers, and expanded grocery lines) signals management's confidence in the brand's elasticity.

## Section 4: Macro Signals

### 4.1 US GDP Growth

**Current Estimate**: GDPNow tracking +4.2% SAAR for Q4 2025 (as of 2/2/2026)
**Consensus 2026 Forecast**: 1.8% -- 2.8% range (Philadelphia Fed SPF: 1.8%; Goldman Sachs: 2.5-2.8%)
**Direction**: SOLID but moderating from Q4 strength

**COST Impact Assessment**: **POSITIVE**. GDP growth above 2% is the Goldilocks zone for Costco -- strong enough to support consumer spending, but not so hot that consumers abandon value-seeking behavior. The wide forecast range (1.8% to 2.8%) reflects uncertainty around tariff impacts and Fed policy, but even the low end of the range would support Costco's business.

### 4.2 Housing Market

**Current Status**: Market in "recalibration" -- soft but not collapsing
- Pending home sales: -3.3% YoY
- Median home price: $379,950, +1.2% YoY
- Days on market: 64 days (longest in 6 years)
- Mortgage rate: ~6.1% (near 3-year low)
- New listings: +1.1% YoY (third straight week of increases)
**Direction**: SOFT but stabilizing

**COST Impact Assessment**: **MILD DRAG**. Housing transactions directly impact Costco through several categories:
- Appliances, furniture, home improvement supplies (bought during moves/renovations)
- Home electronics and decor
- These categories represent an estimated 10-15% of Costco's non-food sales

The soft housing market means fewer move-triggered purchases, but the stabilization in mortgage rates and emerging seller activity suggest the drag is not intensifying. This is a "watch" signal rather than a "concern" signal.

---

### 4.3 Tariff Risk (Elevated -- Key Thesis Risk)

**Current Status**:
- ~33% of Costco's US sales come from imported products
- ~8% of US sales specifically from China-sourced goods
- Costco has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking full refund of tariffs paid under IEEPA
- Company pursuing multi-pronged mitigation: inventory pull-forward, alternative sourcing, SKU substitution
- Costco has absorbed cost increases on key staple items rather than passing them to consumers

**Direction**: ELEVATED RISK -- active and unresolved

**COST Impact Assessment**: **MATERIAL RISK -- requires close monitoring**. The tariff situation creates three pressure points:
1. **Margin compression**: If Costco absorbs tariff costs (as it's doing for some fresh foods), it directly erodes gross margin.
2. **Price increases**: If Costco passes costs through, it undermines the value proposition and could slow traffic.
3. **Supply chain disruption**: Redirecting sourcing away from China takes 6-18 months and may result in quality inconsistency.

**Mitigating factors**: Costco's Kirkland Signature brand gives it more supply chain flexibility than retailers dependent on branded imports. The lawsuit (seeking retroactive refunds) could provide upside if successful. And Costco's buying power (the 3rd largest retailer globally) gives it leverage to negotiate cost-sharing with vendors.

**Key dates to watch**: Court of International Trade hearing schedule; any Supreme Court tariff rulings; quarterly earnings margin guidance.

---

### 4.4 Currency / US Dollar (DXY)

**Current Reading**: DXY ~97.5 (near multi-month low)
**2026 Outlook**: Consensus expects gradual dollar weakening; rates drifting toward 3% range by late 2026
**Direction**: WEAKENING trend with near-term volatility

**COST Impact Assessment**: **TAILWIND**. A weaker dollar benefits Costco in two ways:
1. **Translation effect**: International segment revenues (Canada, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, UK, etc.) translate into more US dollars when the greenback weakens. Costco's international operations represent ~27% of total revenue.
2. **Competitiveness**: A weaker dollar makes US-sourced Kirkland products more price-competitive in international markets.

The January comp data already hints at this: Canada comps of +11.4% and Other International comps of +9.5% partly reflect favorable FX translation. The ex-FX figures were lower but still strong.

## Section 5: Valuation Context & Signal Synthesis

### Current Valuation

| Metric | COST | 5-Year Avg | 10-Year Avg | Assessment |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| P/E (TTM) | 52.8x | ~42x | ~38x | 37% premium to 10-yr avg |
| Forward P/E | 46.8x | ~37x | ~33x | Elevated |
| Price | $978.35 | -- | -- | Near all-time highs |

The valuation is the elephant in the room. At 52.8x trailing earnings, Costco trades at a 37% premium to its own 10-year average P/E. This prices in substantial future growth and near-flawless execution.

### Signal Synthesis: What the Dashboard Tells Us

**Bull Case Signals (10 of 14 favorable)**:
- Consumer trade-down behavior benefits value retailers like Costco
- Real wages growing -- supporting both membership fees and basket sizes
- Comp sales accelerating (+7.1% January) with e-commerce surging (+34.4%)
- Membership economics pristine -- 92.3% renewal, Executive upgrades at 9.1%
- Food CPI spread widening -- structural tailwind for grocery at home
- GDP solid enough to sustain spending; dollar weakening aids international
- Kirkland expansion provides margin buffer and tariff mitigation

**Bear Case Signals (2 risks + 2 watches)**:
- **Tariff risk** is real and unresolved -- 33% import exposure with active litigation
- **Valuation** at 52.8x earnings leaves zero margin for error
- Personal savings rate declining (consumer buffer thinning)
- Housing market softness creating mild drag on home goods categories
