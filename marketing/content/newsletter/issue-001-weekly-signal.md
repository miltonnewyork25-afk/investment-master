### 📊 What The Data Is Telling Us

**The Bull Case (Score > 65):**
Three semiconductor equipment makers — LRCX, AMAT, and KLAC — are scoring above 70 with NO risk flags. This combination has historically preceded 80-150% returns over 18 months.

Key factors driving the scores:
1. **Valuation**: Trading near historical median (not expensive)
2. **Evidence**: Strong supply chain signals (CapEx orders improving)
3. **Momentum**: Industry PMI stabilizing after 12-month decline

**The Bear Case (What Could Go Wrong):**
- China export restrictions could delay recovery
- AI CapEx could shift away from traditional semicap
- Fed rate path remains uncertain

### 🚨 Risk Alerts

**Avoid These:**
- **INTC (18/100)**: Active losses + revenue decline. No cycle recovery signal yet.
- **AMD (40/100)**: Valuation overheated relative to growth deceleration.
- **NVDA (47/100)**: Everyone's favorite, but the framework says it's priced for perfection.

**Watch List:**
- **MU (66/100)**: Approaching buy zone. Memory cycle may be turning.
- **ACLS (68/100)**: High score but customer concentration risk.

### 🔬 Deep Dive: Why LRCX Scores 72

LRCX (Lam Research) is the framework's top pick this week. Here's the breakdown:

| Dimension | Score | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Valuation | 70/100 | P/E near 5-year median |
| Evidence | 79/100 | Fab utilization rising, CapEx orders confirmed |
| Momentum | 65/100 | WFE forecast revisions turning positive |

**Key Insight**: LRCX is a pure-play semiconductor equipment company with 50%+ etch market share. When the cycle turns, it's one of the highest-beta plays.

### 📅 What's Next

**Checkpoints to watch:**
- Jan 29: LRCX earnings (validate CapEx trend)
- Feb: SEMI equipment bookings data
- March: ISM Manufacturing PMI

**Next week's coverage:** We'll add momentum scoring for memory stocks (MU, SK Hynix, Samsung) as DRAM spot prices show signs of bottoming.
