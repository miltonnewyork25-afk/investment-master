### [00:00-00:30] HOOK (30秒)

**[面对镜头]**

"What if I told you there's an investment framework that has been 100% accurate across 164 data points over the past 10 years?

And right now — January 2026 — it's flashing the same buy signal it showed right before semiconductor stocks rallied 80 to 150%.

In this video, I'm going to show you exactly how this framework works, the data behind it, and what it's telling us right now. No BS, no hype — just the methodology.

Let's go."

### [00:30-02:00] THE PROBLEM (1.5分钟)

**[屏幕录制: 股票图表]**

"Here's the problem most investors face with cyclical stocks.

Look at this chart of LRCX — Lam Research. It's a semiconductor equipment company.

**[标注图表上的周期]**

Over the past 10 years, it's gone through 3 major cycles. Each time:
- At the BOTTOM, when the stock was cheapest, sentiment was terrible. Everyone was saying 'semiconductor is dead.'
- At the TOP, when it was most expensive, everyone was euphoric. 'AI will drive semiconductor forever!'

**[切回面对镜头]**

Most people buy at the top and sell at the bottom. Not because they're stupid — but because they have NO SYSTEM to tell them WHERE they are in the cycle.

That's what I built."

### [02:00-06:00] THE FRAMEWORK (4分钟)

**[屏幕: 5维度图表]**

"The framework scores every stock on a 0 to 100 scale using 5 dimensions. Let me walk through each one.

**Dimension 1: Cycle Positioning**

**[动画: 周期图 Recovery→Expansion→Peak→Contraction]**

Where are we in the cycle? The key insight is: don't look at absolute numbers. Look at the RATE OF CHANGE.

When revenue is still declining, but the RATE of decline is slowing... that's the recovery signal. That's where you want to be paying attention.

**Dimension 2: Leading Indicators**

**[屏幕: 各行业指标列表]**

Each industry has specific metrics that lead stock prices by 6 to 24 months. For semiconductors:
- Wafer Fab Equipment bookings
- Fab utilization rates
- DRAM spot prices
- CapEx announcements from TSMC and Samsung

When these INFLECT — change direction — even if they're still at low absolute levels, that's the bottom signal.

**Dimension 3: Valuation**

**[屏幕: P/E 历史图]**

Is the stock cheap relative to its own history? I compare current P/E, EV/EBITDA, and FCF yield against the 10-year median.

But here's the important thing — valuation alone is NOT enough. A stock can be cheap for years during a downturn. That's why it's just one of five dimensions.

**Dimension 4: Financial Health**

**[屏幕: 资产负债表关键指标]**

Can the company SURVIVE the downturn? Debt levels, cash runway, interest coverage. If a company might go bankrupt, it doesn't matter how cheap it is.

**Dimension 5: Supply Chain Intelligence**

**[屏幕: 供应链关系图]**

I mapped the entire S&P 500 supply chain. This lets you see demand signals BEFORE they show up in earnings.

When TSMC announces increased CapEx... that's a signal for LRCX, AMAT, and ASML months before their own earnings reflect it."

### [06:00-08:00] BACKTEST PROOF (2分钟)

**[屏幕: 回测结果表格]**

"Now let's talk proof.

I backtested this framework across:
- 8 cyclical industries
- 14 tech companies
- 10 years of data
- 164 individual scoring events

Result: 100% directional accuracy.

**[切回面对镜头]**

Now, 'directional accuracy' means: when the framework scored above 65, subsequent 12-18 month returns were positive. When below 35, returns were negative.

It does NOT predict exact bottoms. You might be 1-3 months early. But it identifies the ZONE of opportunity.

**[屏幕: 具体案例]**

Let me show you a specific example. In Q4 2019, the framework scored LRCX at 71. What happened? The stock went from $260 to $680 over the next 18 months. That's a 160% return.

The framework saw the cycle bottom forming while most analysts were still bearish."

---

### [08:00-10:30] CURRENT SIGNALS (2.5分钟)

**[屏幕: 当前评分表]**

"So what's the framework saying RIGHT NOW?

As of January 19, 2026:

LRCX — score 72. Buy zone.
AMAT — score 70. Buy zone.
KLAC — score 70. Buy zone.
MU — score 66. Approaching.

These are the HIGHEST scores since the last cycle bottom.

**[切回面对镜头]**

But not everything is a buy.

NVDA scores only 47. Yes, it's a great company. But the valuation is stretched. The framework says: be careful.

INTC scores 18. That's a red flag — active losses, declining revenue, no recovery signals yet.

**[屏幕: 风险标志表]**

And look at the risk flags:
- ASML: Valuation overheated despite high evidence score
- SKHYNIX: Insufficient evidence — we need more data
- AMD: Valuation concern + evidence gap

The framework doesn't just tell you what to buy. It tells you what to AVOID."

### [10:30-12:00] LIMITATIONS & HONESTY (1.5分钟)

**[面对镜头，严肃表情]**

"Now, I want to be completely transparent about limitations.

1. Backtesting is not a prediction. Past accuracy doesn't guarantee future results.

2. The framework identifies ZONES, not exact bottoms. You might buy a stock and watch it drop another 10% before recovering. That's normal.

3. It works best for CYCLICAL industries. If you're looking at pure disruption plays — a startup with no revenue — this isn't the right tool.

4. Some industries have limited cycle data. 2-3 cycles is the minimum, and that's not a massive sample size.

5. Black swan events can break any model.

I believe the value is in removing emotion from investing and replacing it with a systematic process. But no system is perfect."

### [12:00-13:30] WHY OPEN SOURCE + CTA (1.5分钟)

**[面对镜头]**

"One more thing that's important to me: this framework is completely open source and transparent.

If you can't audit an investment framework, you shouldn't trust it. Wall Street sells you black boxes. I'm giving you a glass box.

The full methodology, scoring logic, and backtest data are available for review.

**[屏幕: Newsletter 预览]**

I publish weekly scoring updates every Sunday — covering 19 semiconductor stocks with:
- Updated scores and rankings
- New evidence and indicator changes
- Risk flag updates
- Supply chain intelligence
