## 画面 + 旁白

**[0-6s] HOOK**
画面: LRCX股价图 +305% 上涨 → 突然叠加红色 "23.5/100" 大字
旁白: "Lam Research is up 305%. 25 analysts say Buy. Our AI says SELL. Score: 23.5 out of 100."

**[6-15s] PROBLEM**
画面: 4年周期图动画 (2023底→2024→2025→2026 peak标记)
旁白: "Here's why. Semiconductor equipment follows a 4-year cycle. We're in Year 3. Historically, stocks peak 6-12 months BEFORE earnings peak."

**[15-25s] EVIDENCE**
画面: P/E倍数从15x(2023) 动画上升到 50x(today), 闪红
旁白: "P/E is 50x — double the historical median. At this valuation, even a earnings beat is already priced in. This is what we call Top Divergence."

**[25-35s] INSIDER SIGNAL**
画面: 柱状图显示insider买卖 (Q1: 25 buys vs 39 sells)
旁白: "Insiders net sold in Q1. Meanwhile, their competitor's CEO bought 7 million dollars of his own stock. Follow the smart money."

**[35-50s] SCENARIO**
画面: 三格概率表 (Bull 30%/+31%, Base 45%/+5%, Bear 25%/-30%)
旁白: "The math: Best case plus 31%. Base case plus 5%. Worst case minus 30%. Weighted expected return? One percent. You're risking 30% downside for 1% expected gain."

**[50-60s] CTA**
画面: 框架Logo + "Earnings Wed Jan 29" + "Follow for the result"
旁白: "LRCX reports Wednesday. Whether we're right or wrong, I'll post the full scorecard. Follow for transparent, AI-powered cycle signals."
