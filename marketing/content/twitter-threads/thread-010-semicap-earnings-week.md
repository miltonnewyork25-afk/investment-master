# Thread #010: Semicap Earnings Week — The Sector Verdict

**发布时间**: Jan 27, 2026 (Mon) 7AM EST — 与LRCX preview同日但更早
**目标**: 建立"Earnings Week"叙事弧，将4个单独事件统一为1个大故事
**Hook偏误触发**: 锚定(4只股票+具体分数) + 好奇心(全部Top Divergence) + 损失厌恶(sector peak) + 社交货币(行业综述=高转发)

## Tweet 1/9 (Hook)

🚨 This week, 3 of the 4 biggest semiconductor equipment companies report earnings:

ASML → Tuesday (Jan 28)
LRCX → Wednesday (Jan 29)
KLAC → Wednesday (Jan 29)

Our AI framework scores ALL of them as "Top Divergence" — a SELL signal.

Here's what's happening 🧵

---

## Tweet 2/9 (The Sector Signal)

This isn't about one stock.

When an ENTIRE sector triggers "Top Divergence" simultaneously, it means something structural:

The semiconductor equipment cycle may be approaching its peak.

Our framework's sector scores:
• ASML: 23.5/100 ❌
• LRCX: 23.5/100 ❌
• AMAT: 31.0/100 ⚠️
• KLAC: ~30/100 ⚠️ (estimated)

---

## Tweet 3/9 (Why It Matters)

Semiconductor equipment is a LEADING indicator for the broader chip sector.

Equipment orders → Fab construction → Chip production → Tech earnings

If equipment stocks peak NOW, it means:
- Chip stocks peak in 6-12 months
- Tech earnings peak in 12-18 months

This is the canary in the coal mine.

## Tweet 4/9 (The 4-Year Clock)

All four stocks follow the same 4-year memory cycle:

2023 = Trough ✅ (stocks bottomed)
2024 = Recovery ✅ (stocks rallied)
2025 = Expansion ✅ (stocks kept rising)
2026 = Peak Risk ⚠️ (we are HERE)

Average gain from trough: +200-300%
Current average gain: +250%

The cycle math says: time to be cautious.

## Tweet 5/9 (ASML Tomorrow)

ASML reports FIRST (Tuesday).

Key to watch:
- EUV order book (leading indicator for 2027)
- China revenue guidance (export control impact)
- Gross margin trend (peak margins = peak cycle)

Our framework: 23.5/100
Evidence score: 98/100 (amazing business!)
Valuation score: 35/100 (way too expensive)

Great company. Bad price.

## Tweet 6/9 (LRCX + KLAC Wednesday)

Then LRCX and KLAC report on the SAME DAY.

LRCX (Etch + Deposition):
- P/E: 50.4x | Score: 23.5 | +305% from trough
- Key: Memory CAPEX guidance

KLAC (Inspection + Metrology):
- P/E: 47.8x | Score: ~30 | +176% from trough
- Key: Advanced node demand signals

If both disappoint on guidance → sector thesis confirmed.

---

## Tweet 7/9 (What Would Change Our Mind)

Our framework is FALSIFIABLE. Here's what would upgrade the scores:

✅ HBM guidance ABOVE current expectations (not just "in line")
✅ China revenue stable despite export controls
✅ Forward CAPEX guidance raised (not just maintained)
✅ Gross margins still expanding (not plateauing)

If ALL of these happen → the supercycle thesis wins.

---

## Tweet 8/9 (The Asymmetry)

Even in the BEST case, the risk/reward is poor:

| Scenario | Probability | Sector Return |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Supercycle extends | 30% | +25% |
| Meets expectations | 45% | +5% |
| Cycle peaks | 25% | -30% |
| **Weighted** | **100%** | **+2%** |

You're risking -30% for +2% expected return.

Would you take that bet?

## Tweet 9/9 (CTA — Reply-Driving)

I'll be posting live reactions to each earnings report:
- Tue PM: ASML scorecard
- Wed PM: LRCX + KLAC scorecard
- Feb 12: AMAT (final verdict)

## 内部注释

### 叙事弧设计 (Narrative Arc)
```
Mon: "The Setup" (这就是即将发生的事)
     ↓ 悬念建立
Tue PM: "First Signal" (ASML验证或否定)
     ↓ 数据积累
Wed PM: "The Confirmation" (LRCX+KLAC同日 = 统计显著性)
     ↓ 结论形成
Feb 12: "The Verdict" (AMAT作为最终裁判)
```

### 事件驱动放大效应
- 单个stock earnings = 1x attention
- Sector earnings week = 3-4x attention (话题叠加效应)
- 叙事弧 = 持续4天的连续关注 → 更高follow转化率
- 对错都有内容 → 永赢策略在sector级别应用

### 交叉引用策略
- Thread #010 (本thread) 引用 → Thread #008 (LRCX详析)
- Thread #010 引用 → Thread #006 (供应链分析)
- ASML reaction → 引用 Thread #010 的预测
- LRCX reaction → 引用 Thread #008 + Thread #010
- 每个后续内容都回溯引用前一个 → 累积信任效应
