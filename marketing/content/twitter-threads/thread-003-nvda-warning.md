**1/8 [HOOK]**
Everyone's favorite stock — NVDA — only scores 47/100 on my framework.

Meanwhile, LRCX scores 72.

Same semiconductor industry. Wildly different signals.

Here's why the framework disagrees with Wall Street consensus 👇

**2/8 [THE PARADOX]**
NVDA is a great company. Nobody disputes that.

But "great company" ≠ "great investment at this price."

The framework doesn't care about narratives. It cares about data:
• Where are we in the cycle?
• Is the valuation reasonable?
• What do leading indicators say?

**3/8 [VALUATION: 35/100]** 🚨
This is the killer.

NVDA is trading at a P/E significantly above its 5-year median. The market is pricing in perfection.

When you buy at these multiples, you need EVERYTHING to go right. One earnings miss and you're looking at 30%+ downside.

**4/8 [EVIDENCE: 30/100]**
Surprisingly low. Why?

The framework measures SUPPLY CHAIN evidence of cycle positioning. NVDA's evidence is mixed:
- AI demand is strong, but...
- Traditional GPU demand is mature
- Data center CapEx may be peaking
- Competition increasing (AMD MI300, custom chips)

**5/8 [MOMENTUM: 90/100]**
Yes, momentum is strong. The stock has been on a tear.

But here's the framework's philosophy: HIGH momentum + LOW valuation = buy signal. HIGH momentum + HIGH valuation = caution.

Strong momentum makes you feel good. The framework asks: "Is this already priced in?"

**6/8 [RISK FLAG: 估值过热]**
NVDA is one of only 4 stocks (out of 19) with a "Valuation Overheated" flag.

The others: ASML, AMD, ENTG.

When the market loves something unanimously, the framework gets nervous.

**7/8 [THE COMPARISON]**
| | LRCX (72) | NVDA (47) |
|---|---|---|
| Valuation | 70 (fair) | 35 (expensive) |
| Evidence | 79 (strong) | 30 (mixed) |
| Momentum | 65 (moderate) | 90 (extreme) |
| Risk Flags | None | Valuation hot |
| Consensus | Ignored | Beloved |

The framework's sweet spot: overlooked + improving + fair price.

**8/8 [THE LESSON]**
The best investments aren't the most popular stocks.

They're the ones where:
✅ The cycle is turning
✅ Nobody's paying attention
✅ Valuation gives you margin of safety
✅ Leading indicators confirm the turn

That's LRCX today. Not NVDA.
