**1/8 [HOOK]**
Two semiconductor stocks.
Same industry. Same macro.

LRCX scores 72/100 ✅
INTC scores 18/100 🚨

How can the gap be THIS wide?

The answer reveals everything about cycle investing 👇

**2/8 [THE DIFFERENCE]**
LRCX (Lam Research) = sells equipment to chip fabs
INTC (Intel) = IS a chip fab (and struggling)

One BENEFITS from the cycle turning.
The other is FIGHTING for survival during the cycle.

Same "semiconductor" label. Completely different dynamics.

**3/8 [LRCX BREAKDOWN]**
LRCX score 72:
• Valuation: 70 — fair price, near median
• Evidence: 79 — fab orders improving
• Momentum: 65 — rate of decline slowing
• Risk flags: NONE

This is the textbook "cycle recovery" signal.

**4/8 [INTC BREAKDOWN]**
INTC score 18:
• Valuation: 0 — currently unprofitable (P/E meaningless)
• Evidence: 30 — no recovery signals
• Momentum: 25 — still declining
• Risk flags: 🚨 Active losses + Revenue declining

This is NOT a cycle bottom. This is fundamental deterioration.

**5/8 [KEY LESSON]**
"Cheap" and "at the bottom" are NOT the same thing.

INTC is "cheap" — stock is down 60% from highs.
But the framework sees NO inflection signals.

Buying INTC now is NOT contrarian investing.
It's catching a falling knife.

**6/8 [WHEN WOULD INTC SCORE HIGHER?]**
The framework would upgrade INTC when:
□ Revenue decline SLOWS (rate of change improves)
□ Foundry orders show ANY positive signal
□ Cost restructuring shows measurable impact
□ Cash flow returns to positive

None of these are happening yet.

**7/8 [THE FRAMEWORK'S POWER]**
This is why systematic scoring > gut feeling.

"Semiconductor stocks are at a bottom" — too broad.
"LRCX is at a bottom but INTC is not" — precise.

The framework distinguishes between INDUSTRY cycle recovery and COMPANY-specific decline.

**8/8 [CTA]**
Not all "beaten down" stocks are buys.
Not all "expensive" stocks are sells.

The framework scores EACH stock individually across 5 dimensions.
