**1/9 [HOOK]**
I mapped the supply chain relationships of 500+ S&P 500 companies.

Here's what it reveals about semiconductor stocks right now — and why it gives me a 6-12 month edge over earnings reports. 🧵

**2/9 [WHY SUPPLY CHAIN]**
Earnings reports tell you what HAPPENED.
Supply chains tell you what's ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

When TSMC places equipment orders → LRCX revenue rises 6 months later.
When DRAM prices bottom → MU margins improve 2 quarters later.

The signal comes BEFORE the stock moves.

**3/9 [THE MAP]**
For semiconductors, the chain looks like this:

AI demand → Cloud CapEx (MSFT/GOOGL/AMZN)
→ Chip orders (TSMC/Samsung)
→ Equipment orders (LRCX/AMAT/KLAC)
→ Materials demand (ENTG/MKSI)

Each step has a time lag. That lag = your edge.

**4/9 [CURRENT SIGNALS]**
What the supply chain is saying RIGHT NOW:

✅ TSMC 2026 CapEx guidance: INCREASED
✅ Samsung restarting investment cycle
✅ DRAM spot prices: stabilizing after 12-month decline
✅ WFE forecast revisions: turning positive

ALL pointing the same direction: equipment demand recovering.

**5/9 [THE CONFIRMATION]**
When MULTIPLE supply chain nodes confirm the same direction, conviction is highest.

Upstream (TSMC CapEx) ✅
Midstream (Equipment bookings) ✅
Downstream (End demand AI/HPC) ✅

This is what the framework's "Evidence" score measures. LRCX evidence: 79/100.

**6/9 [CONTRARIAN EXAMPLE]**
Now look at INTC (score: 18):

❌ Foundry customers: not adopting Intel 18A yet
❌ PC demand: flat
❌ Server share: still losing to AMD
❌ Government subsidies: delayed impact

The supply chain is NOT confirming recovery for Intel. The data is clear.

**7/9 [HOW I USE IT]**
My scoring framework weights supply chain evidence heavily because:

1. It's forward-looking (6-12 months ahead)
2. It's objective (orders either exist or they don't)
3. It captures the ECOSYSTEM, not just one company
4. It filters noise from analyst opinions

**8/9 [THE EDGE]**
Most investors read earnings calls AFTER the fact.

I watch:
• CapEx guidance from top-3 foundries
• SEMI monthly equipment bookings
• DRAM/NAND spot price trends
• Fab utilization surveys

These tell me where earnings are GOING, not where they've BEEN.

**9/9 [CTA]**
I built this supply chain map for 500+ companies across 60+ industry chains.

Every week I translate it into actionable scores for 19 semiconductor stocks.
