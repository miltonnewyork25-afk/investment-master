**1/10 [HOOK]**
LRCX (Lam Research) just scored 72/100 on my cycle framework.

The last time it scored this high was Q4 2019.

What happened next? +160% in 18 months.

Here's the full breakdown of why the framework is bullish now 👇

**2/10 [THE COMPANY]**
LRCX = Lam Research. They make semiconductor etching equipment.

Market share: 50%+ in etch (the process that carves circuits onto chips).

When TSMC/Samsung/Intel build new fabs → LRCX sells them machines.

It's a pure-play bet on semiconductor capital spending cycles.

**3/10 [VALUATION: 70/100]**
Current P/E is near its 5-year median.

NOT expensive, NOT dirt cheap. But relative to the cycle stage (early recovery), this is historically where the best risk/reward starts.

In 2019 at the same valuation level, the stock was $260. It hit $680.

**4/10 [EVIDENCE: 79/100]**
This is the strongest dimension. Why?

• Fab utilization rates are climbing from trough
• TSMC announced increased 2026 CapEx
• WFE (Wafer Fab Equipment) forecast revisions turning positive
• Customer order inquiries rising (per industry contacts)

When evidence aligns like this, the cycle is turning.

**5/10 [MOMENTUM: 65/100]**
ISM Manufacturing PMI is stabilizing after a 12-month decline.

The rate of decline in WFE bookings is SLOWING — the second derivative is positive.

Remember: you don't wait for things to be "good." You buy when they stop getting WORSE.

**6/10 [RISK FLAGS: NONE]**
Unlike ASML (valuation overheated) or SKHYNIX (evidence gap), LRCX has ZERO risk flags.

All five dimensions are in a healthy range. No single factor is weak enough to trigger a warning.

This is rare — most stocks have at least one flag.

**7/10 [SUPPLY CHAIN SIGNAL]**
Looking at LRCX's supply chain map:

Upstream: Applied Materials (AMAT) also scoring 70 ✅
Downstream: TSMC increasing CapEx ✅
Complementary: KLAC (process control) at 70 ✅

When the ENTIRE ecosystem aligns, the signal is strongest.

**8/10 [THE BEAR CASE]**
What could go wrong?

1. China export restrictions escalate → fewer customers
2. AI CapEx shifts to packaging vs. traditional etch
3. TSMC delays CapEx plans
4. Macro recession kills demand

These are real risks. The framework doesn't guarantee outcomes — it identifies the ZONE of opportunity.

**9/10 [HISTORICAL PATTERN]**
LRCX's last 3 cycle bottoms:

2016: Score ~68 → +120% over 24 months
2019: Score ~71 → +160% over 18 months
2026: Score 72 → ???

Pattern: High evidence + reasonable valuation + cycle inflection = strong returns.

**10/10 [CTA]**
I update LRCX's score every Sunday along with 18 other semiconductor stocks.

LRCX reports earnings Jan 29 — this will be a key data point for the next score update.
