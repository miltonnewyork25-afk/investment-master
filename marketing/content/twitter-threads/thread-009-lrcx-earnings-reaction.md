## 场景A: 框架正确（股价平盘/下跌，或guidance不及预期）

### Tweet 1/8 (Hook - Scenario A)

$LRCX just reported.

Revenue: [BEAT/MISS]
EPS: [BEAT/MISS]
Stock: [DOWN/FLAT]

Two days ago, our AI scored LRCX 23.5/100 — "Top Divergence."

The framework's verdict: [CONFIRMED/PARTIALLY CONFIRMED]

Here's the scorecard 🧵

### Tweet 2/8

Reminder of what our framework flagged:

✅ Predicted: Beat on revenue (happened)
✅ Predicted: Stock wouldn't rally on beat (happening)
✅ Predicted: Guidance cautious/flat (check below)
⬜ Key risk noted: China 42% exposure

The "Top Divergence" signal means: great numbers, already priced in.

### Tweet 3/8

What the guidance revealed:

[Insert actual guidance data]

This is exactly what late-cycle looks like:
- Current quarter: strong
- Forward visibility: narrowing
- Management tone: [cautious/confident but hedging]

### Tweet 4/8

Updated framework score post-earnings:

Pre-earnings: 23.5/100
Post-earnings: [NEW SCORE]/100

Key changes:
- [Factor 1]
- [Factor 2]
- [Factor 3]

### Tweet 5/8

For those who followed our pre-earnings thread:

The framework didn't predict a "crash."
It predicted: BAD RISK/REWARD.

+305% from trough + 50x P/E + Y3 cycle = limited upside, significant downside.

That math hasn't changed.

### Tweet 6/8

This is what "cycle intelligence" means:

We're not perma-bears. We called LRCX a BUY at the 2023 trough.

But cycle investing means:
- Buy when nobody wants it
- Sell when everybody loves it

Today, 25 analysts love LRCX. That IS the signal.

### Tweet 7/8

Running tally of framework predictions:

| Signal | Date | Prediction | Result |
|--------|------|-----------|--------|
| LRCX | Jan 27 | Top Divergence | ✅/⬜ |
| [Prior signals] | ... | ... | ... |

Accuracy: [X]% (all-time)

## 场景B: 框架错误（股价大涨，guidance超预期）

### Tweet 1/8 (Hook - Scenario B)

$LRCX just reported.

Revenue: BEAT
Guidance: ABOVE expectations
Stock: +[X]%

Our AI scored it 23.5/100 two days ago.

Looks like the HBM supercycle is stronger than cycle math.

Here's our honest scorecard 🧵

### Tweet 2/8

Let's be transparent about what happened:

❌ Our signal: Top Divergence (23.5/100)
✅ Reality: Market rewarded the beat
📊 Possible explanation: HBM supercycle extending the normal 4-year cycle

We track this because hiding misses is what Wall Street does. We don't.

### Tweet 3/8

What our framework got RIGHT:
- Fundamentals are excellent (confirmed)
- Revenue acceleration (confirmed)
- FCF quality (confirmed)

What we got WRONG (or early on):
- Cycle timing: HBM may extend the peak by [1-2 years]
- Valuation: Market willing to pay more for structural growth

### Tweet 4/8

Key lesson: "Top Divergence" in a SUPERCYCLE may behave differently.

Normal 4-year cycle → Y3 = danger zone ✅ (historically correct)
HBM supercycle → Y3 might just be the MIDPOINT ⬜ (new possibility)

We're updating our framework to weight supercycle indicators more heavily.

### Tweet 5/8

Updated framework score:

Pre-earnings: 23.5/100
Post-earnings: [NEW SCORE]/100 (accounting for guidance beat)

If HBM guidance was truly exceptional, the cycle clock resets.
This would make LRCX a HOLD rather than SELL.

### Tweet 6/8

This is how a framework EVOLVES:

1. Make predictions based on data
2. Track outcomes transparently
3. Analyze where the model was wrong
4. Update the model
5. Repeat

No ego. No "I was right all along." Just data.

### Tweet 7/8

Running tally:

| Signal | Date | Prediction | Result |
|--------|------|-----------|--------|
| LRCX | Jan 27 | Top Divergence | ❌ (short-term) / ⬜ (6-month check pending) |

Note: We grade at 30, 90, and 180 days. One earnings ≠ final verdict.

### Tweet 8/8 (CTA)

The difference between us and gurus:

Gurus delete wrong predictions.
We publish them.

Because a framework that can't be proven wrong isn't a framework — it's astrology.
