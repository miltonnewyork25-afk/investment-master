**1/12 [HOOK]**
Most investors lose 30-50% in every cycle downturn.

After testing 164 data points over 10 years, I found 10 rules that caught EVERY cycle turn in advance.

Rule #7 is the one Wall Street won't tell you. 🧵👇

**2/12 [RULE 1]**
Rule 1: Buy when the rate of decline SLOWS, not when things are "good."

Most investors wait for confirmation. By then, you've missed 50% of the move.

The cycle bottom isn't when revenue starts growing. It's when it STOPS getting worse.

**3/12 [RULE 2]**
Rule 2: Valuation alone is not a timing signal.

A stock can be "cheap" for 2 years during a downturn.

Cheap + Improving + Leading Indicators Positive = Signal.
Cheap + Still Declining + No Leading Signals = Value Trap.

**4/12 [RULE 3]**
Rule 3: The consensus is ALWAYS wrong at extremes.

At cycle bottoms: "This industry is dead"
At cycle peaks: "This time is different"

When everyone agrees, the cycle is about to turn.

**5/12 [RULE 4]**
Rule 4: Follow the supply chain, not the headlines.

When TSMC announces CapEx increases → LRCX/AMAT will see orders → Their revenue will improve.

Supply chain signals lead stock prices by 6-12 months.

**6/12 [RULE 5]**
Rule 5: Use multiple dimensions, never a single metric.

One indicator can lie. Five indicators aligned = high conviction.

The framework uses: Cycle position + Leading indicators + Valuation + Financial health + Supply chain.

**7/12 [RULE 6]**
Rule 6: Accept that you'll buy "too early."

If you're buying at the bottom, it won't feel good. Prices may drop another 10-15% before recovering.

That's okay. Zone identification > exact timing.

**8/12 [RULE 7]**
Rule 7: Risk flags override scores.

A stock scoring 75 with a "Valuation Overheated" flag is NOT the same as one scoring 70 with zero flags.

Always check what could go wrong, not just what could go right.

**9/12 [RULE 8]**
Rule 8: Cycles are predictable in direction, NOT in timing.

You can know a recovery is coming without knowing if it's 3 months or 9 months away.

Position for the direction. Use checkpoints to manage timing.

**10/12 [RULE 9]**
Rule 9: The best opportunities feel the worst.

Semiconductor stocks at cycle bottoms feel terrifying:
- Revenue declining
- Analyst downgrades
- Headlines negative

That's the point. The fear IS the signal.

**11/12 [RULE 10]**
Rule 10: Be systematic, not emotional.

Every decision should be traceable to a specific signal.
"I feel bullish" → meaningless.
"Score moved from 55 to 72 because leading indicators inflected" → actionable.

Systems beat instincts over time.

**12/12 [CTA]**
These 10 rules are the foundation of my framework.

Every week I publish scores for 19 semiconductor stocks based on these principles.
