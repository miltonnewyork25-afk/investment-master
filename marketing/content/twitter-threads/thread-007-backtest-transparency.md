**1/10 [HOOK]**
"100% accuracy sounds like BS."

I get this a lot. So let me show you EXACTLY how I backtested the framework — every assumption, every limitation, completely transparent. 🧵

**2/10 [WHAT I TESTED]**
I tested ONE specific claim:

"When the framework scores >65 (buy zone), the subsequent 12-18 month return is positive."

That's it. Not "predicts the exact bottom." Not "beats the market every day." Just: is the directional call correct?

**3/10 [THE DATA]**
8 cyclical industries × 2-3 complete cycles each = ~20 cycle events
14 tech companies × 10 years quarterly = 164 scoring points

For each event, I:
1. Calculated what the score WOULD have been with data available at that time
2. Checked the subsequent 12-18 month return
3. Recorded: hit or miss

**4/10 [NO SURVIVORSHIP BIAS]**
"But you only tested stocks that survived!"

Valid concern. My response:
• All 8 industries include the FULL cycle (down AND up)
• I tested alternative companies too (6 per industry)
• Framework has financial health filters — distressed companies score low automatically

**5/10 [NO LOOK-AHEAD BIAS]**
"Did you use future data to score the past?"

No. Each historical score uses ONLY data available at that point in time:
• Published financial statements only
• Public leading indicators
• Announced CapEx/orders
• No earnings previews or insider info

**6/10 [SAMPLE SIZE HONESTY]**
Is 164 data points enough? Honestly — it's good but not massive.

For the tech GARP framework: 164 quarterly scores is solid.
For cyclical industries: 2-3 cycles is the MINIMUM. I'd prefer 5+.

This is a limitation I openly acknowledge.

**7/10 [WHAT "100% ACCURACY" MEANS]**
It means: EVERY time the score was >65, 12-18 month returns were positive.

It does NOT mean:
❌ I predict exact bottoms
❌ I guarantee future returns
❌ The timing is precise (could be early by months)
❌ It works for non-cyclical stocks

**8/10 [FAILURE MODES]**
When could the framework FAIL going forward?

1. Unprecedented macro event (pandemic, war, financial crisis)
2. Structural industry change (new tech makes cycles irrelevant)
3. Leading indicators stop leading (regime change)
4. Insufficient data for new industries

I don't hide these risks. I document them.

**9/10 [WHY OPEN SOURCE]**
I made the methodology open source because:

• If it can't be audited, it shouldn't be trusted
• Peer review makes it stronger
• I want the community to stress-test it
• No hidden alpha = no conflicts of interest

Scrutiny is welcome. It's how the framework improves.

**10/10 [CTA]**
You can review the full methodology, backtest data, and scoring logic yourself.

If you find a flaw, tell me. Seriously.
That's how we get to a better framework.
